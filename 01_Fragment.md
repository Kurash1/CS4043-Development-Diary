# Week 2

After finding the team I'd be working with, and the language and engine we'd be using. I spent the rest of week 2 re-familiarizing myself with them. I already had plenty of experience in the Godot engine, but I hadn't used GDScript as much. So I began reading through the plenty of GDScript documentation. This was less of learning the language, and more of just reminding myself of how the language worked again. After I felt comfortable enough with the concepts in my head, I made a small program that allowed me to send external program signals through a UDP Peer into GDScript.

# Week 3

This is the first week I managed to make it to the labs, as I had ended up having a panic attack right before the labs on Week 2. During the labs we discussed the division of labour, and according to the division of labour I'll begin working on Saturday. So I can't say I've done much as of the writing of this. My role will be to make the enemy, target, and investigator Ai, while also making the primary map of the game. So what I've already done this week is look through some shopping mall blueprints (as that is the setting of our game), and then I worked on my own separate game project where I'm also working with ai, specifically I was re-familiarizing myself with all the parts of it that I used.
